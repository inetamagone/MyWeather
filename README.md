 Weather application

Weather forecast application with navigation fragments and view binding

During the creation process many different approaches are tested and changed to other approaches for learning purposes.
Application calls https://openweathermap.org API for the current weather request in the default or searched city.

In the SecondFragment another call is made, to see the forecast for next hours and days in the searched city. City coordinates are passed from first to the second fragment.

In the History fragment are saved all searches and they can be deleted or sorted.

Application has portrait and landscape xml versions for certain fragments.
